# 3. ANAGRAM STRINGS
    An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each other.\
  Other examples- 1. LISTEN <----> SILENT\
                  2. TRIANGLE <----> INTEGRAL\
  The time complexity of the solution is O(n)
