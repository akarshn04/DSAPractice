This repository just has few practice questions for DSA. 
It contains competitive programming questions & solutions.

# 3. Anagram Strings
   An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters,<br/>only the order of characters can be different.<br/> For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each other.
  Other examples- 1. LISTEN <----> SILENT\
                  2. TRIANGLE <----> INTEGRAL\
  The time complexity of the solution is O(n)
# 4. Add 1 to the number

# 5. Peak of an array
   Given an integer array A of size N.
   You need to check that whether there exist a element which is strictly greater than all the elements on left of it and<br />strictly smaller than all the elements on right of it.

  If it exists return 1 else return 0.
  **NOTE:**
  -Do not consider the corner elements i.e A[0] and A[N-1] as the answer.
